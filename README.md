# Network_analysis_wireshark

This project involves capturing and analyzing network traffic using **Wireshark**, focusing on identifying different protocols and understanding packet structures.

Project Objectives
- Capture network traffic using Wireshark.
- Apply filters to analyze specific protocols (e.g., TCP, UDP, HTTP).
- Identify and document key observations from the captured packets.
- Structure findings and organize submission for clarity.

- 
## Methodology
1. Capturing Traffic:  
   - Used Wireshark to capture packets from the selected network interface.
   - Generated network activity to populate meaningful data.

2. Filtering and Analysis: 
   - Applied protocol filters (`tcp`, `udp`, `http`) to narrow down results.
   - Observed anomalies, structured data interpretation.

3. Findings: 
   - Identified key protocols and their behavior.
   - Notable traffic patterns and security-related insights documented.
